# MuNDy: Multi-body Nonlocal Dynamics

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION (3/25/2025)*: We have chosen to make our development of MuNDy public as we approach our first formal release. This gives us the ability to make a Wiki.

## Release TODO:
- [x] Create a logo!
- [x] Create a mock application for our internal apps to build upon (https://github.com/palmerb4/mundy_mock_app).
- [ ] Setup PR testing, weekly builds, and weekly integration tests.
- [ ] Remove internal apps from Mundy (Brato fibers, HP1, PRC1, StickySettings, Sebastian's model, Min's growing spheres).
- [ ] Move reduced versions of these apps to examples.
- [ ] Remove old MetaMethods in favor of inline functions called by aggregated kernel launchers.
- [ ] Fledge out the Wiki.
- [ ] Polish the Doxygen. Implementation details shouldn't clutter the API.
